  Please upgrade to 3.1.3.

.. _version-3.1.1:

3.1.1
=====
:release-date: 2019-03-27 10:02 A.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Timers: Avoid drift + introduce a tiny bit of drift to timers.

    Thanks to Bob Haddleton (:github_user:`bobh66`) for discovering
    this issue.

.. _version-3.1.0:

3.1.0
=====
:release-date: 2019-03-21 03:26 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Adds :class:`~mode.utils.contexts.nullcontext`
  and :class:`~mode.utils.contexts.asyncnullcontext`.

    Backported from Python 3.7 you can import these
    from :mod:`mode.utils.contexts`.

- Mode project changes:

    + Added :pypi:`bandit` to CI lint build.

    + Added :pypi:`pydocstyle` to CI lint build.

.. _version-3.0.13:

3.0.13
======
:release-date: 2019-03-20 04:58 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Adds ``CompositeLogger.warning`` alias to ``warn``.

    :pypi:`flake8-logging-format` has a rule that says
    you are only allowed to use ``.warning``, so going with that.

.. _version-3.0.12:

3.0.12
======
:release-date: 2019-03-20 03:23 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Adds :func:`~mode.utils.futures.all_tasks` as a backward compatible
  :func:`asyncio.all_tasks`.

- Signal: Fixes ``.connect()`` decorator to work with parens and without

    Signal decorator now works with parens:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        @signal.connect()
        def my_handler(sender, **kwargs):
            ...

    and without parens:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        @signal.connect
        def my_handler(sender, **kwargs):
        ...

- Signal: Do not use weakref by default.

    Using weakref by default meant it was too easy to connect
    a signal handler to only have it disappear because there were
    no more references to the object.

.. _version-3.0.11:

3.0.11
======
:release-date: 2019-03-19 08:50 A.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Adds ThrowableQueue._throw() for non-async version of .throw().

.. _version-3.0.10:

3.0.10
======
:release-date: 2019-03-14 03:55 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Worker: was giving successful exit code when an exception is raised.

    The ``.execute_from_commandline`` method now always exits
    (its return type is :class:`typing.NoReturn`).

- Adds :class:`~mode.utils.compat.NoReturn` to :mod:`mode.utils.compat`.

    Import :class:`typing.NoReturn` from here to support Python versions
    before 3.6.3.

.. _version-3.0.9:

3.0.9
=====
:release-date: 2019-03-08 01:20 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Threads: Add multiple workers for thread method queue.

    Default number of workers is now 2, to allow for
    two recursive calls.

- Signal: Use `Signal.label` instead of ``.indent`` to be more consistent.

- Signal: Properly set ``.name`` when signal is member of class.

- Adds ability to log the FULL traceback of :class:`asyncio.Task`.

- Service: Stop faster if stopped immediately after start

- Service: Correctly track dependencies for services added
  using ``Service.on_init_dependencies`` (Issue #40).

    Contributed by Nimi Wariboko Jr (:github_user:`nemosupremo`).

.. _version-3.0.8:

3.0.8
=====
:release-date: 2019-01-25 03:54 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Fixes ``DeprecationWarning`` importing from ``collections``.

- stampede: Fixed edge case where stampede wrapped function
  called multiple times.

    Calling the same stampede wrapped function multiple times
    within the same event loop iteration would previously call
    the function multiple times.

    For example using :func:`asyncio.gather`:

    .. codeblock:: python

        from mode.utils.futures import stampede

        count = 0
        @stampede
        async def update_count():
            global count
            count += 1

        async def main():
            await asyncio.gather(
                update_count(),
                update_count(),
                update_count(),
                update_count(),
            )

            assert count == 1

    Previously this would call the function four times, but with the
    fix it's only called once and provides the expected result.

- Mocks: Adds :func:`~mode.utils.mocks.mask_module` and
         :func:`~mode.utils.mocks.patch_module`.

- CI: Added Windows build.

- CI: Enabled random order for tests.


.. _version-3.0.7:

3.0.7
=====
:release-date: 2019-01-18 01:12 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- **ServiceThread** ``.stop()`` would wait for thread shutdown
  even if thread was never started.

- **CI**: Adds CPython 3.7.2 and 3.6.8 to build matrix

.. _version-3.0.6:

3.0.6
=====
:release-date: 2019-01-07 12:10 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Adds ``%(extra)s`` as log format option.

    To add additional context to your logging statements use for example::

        logger.error('Foo', extra={'data': {'database': 'db1'}})

.. _version-3.0.5:

3.0.5
=====
:release-date: 2018-12-19 04:40 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Fixes compatibility with :pypi:`colorlog` 4.0.x.

    Contributed by Ryan Whitten (:github_user:`rwhitten577`).

.. _version-3.0.4:

3.0.4
=====
:release-date: 2018-12-07 04:40 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Now depends on :pypi:`mypy_extensions`.

.. _version-3.0.3:

3.0.3
=====
:release-date: 2018-12-07 3:22 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Threads: Fixed delay in shutdown if ``on_thread_stop`` callback raises
  exception.

- Service: Stopping of children no longer propagates exceptions, to ensure
  other services are still stopped.

- Worker: Fixed race condition if worker stopped before being fully started.

    This would lead the worker to shutdown early before fully stopping
    all dependent services.

- Tests: Adds :class:`~mode.utils.mocks.AsyncMagicMock`

.. _version-3.0.2:

3.0.2
=====
:release-date: 2018-12-07 1:14 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Worker: Fixes crash on Windows where signal handlers cannot be registered.

- Utils: Adds :func:`~mode.utils.objects.shortname` to get non-qualified
  object path.

- Utils: Adds :func:`~mode.utils.objects.canonshortname` to get non-qualified
  object path that attempts to resolve the real name of ``__main__``.

.. _version-3.0.1:

3.0.1
=====
:release-date: 2018-12-06 10:20 A.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Worker: Added new callback ``on_worker_shutdown``.

- Worker: Do not stop twice, instead wait for original stop to complete.

    Signals would start multiple stopping coroutines, leading to
    the worker shutting down too fast.

- Threads: All ``ServiceThread`` services needs a keepalive
  coroutine to be scheduled.

- Supervisor: Fixed issue with ``CrashingSupervisor`` where
  service would not crash.

.. _version-3.0.0:

3.0.0
=====
:release-date: 2018-11-30 4:48 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- ``ServiceThread`` no longer uses ``run_in_executor``.

    Since services are long running, it is not a good idea for
    them to block pool worker threads. Instead we run one
    thread for every ServiceThread.

- Adds :class:`~mode.threads.QueuedServiceThread`

    This subclass of :class:`~mode.threads.ServiceThread` enables
    the use of a queue to send work to the service thread.

    This is useful for services that wrap blocking network clients
    for example.

    If you have a blocking Redis client you could run it in a separate
    thread like this:

    .. code-block:: python

        class Redis(QueuedServiceThread):
            _client: StrictRedis = None

            async def on_start(self) -> None:
                self._client = StrictRedis()

            async def get(self, key):
                return await self.call_thread(self._client.get, key)

            async def set(self, key, value):
                await self.call_thread(self._client.set, key, value)

    The actual redis client will be running in a separate thread (with a
    separate event loop). The ``get`` and ``set`` methods will delegate
    to the thread, and return only when the thread is finished handling
    them and is ready with a result:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        async def use_redis():
            # We use async-with-statement here, but
            # can also do `await redis.start()` then `await redis.stop()`
            async with Redis() as redis:
                await redis.set(key='foo', value='bar')
                assert await redis.get(key='foo') == 'bar'

- Collections: ``FastUserSet`` and ``ManagedUserSet`` now implements
  all :class:`set` operations.

- Collections are now generic types.

    You can now subclass collections with typing information:

    - ``class X(FastUserDict[str, int]): ...``
    - ``class X(ManagedUserDict[str, int]): ...``
    - ``class X(FastUserSet[str]): ...``
    - ``class X(ManagedUserSet[str]): ...``

- :func:`~mode.utils.futures.maybe_async` utility now
  also works with ``@asyncio.coroutine`` decorated coroutines.

- Worker: SIGUSR1 cry handler: Fixed crash when coroutine does not have
  ``__name__`` attribute.

.. _version-2.0.4:

2.0.4
=====
:release-date: 2018-11-19 1:07 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- ``FlowControlQueue.clear`` now cancels all waiting for ``Queue.put``.

.. _version-2.0.3:

2.0.3
=====
:release-date: 2018-11-05 5:20 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Adds `Service.wait_first(*coros)`

    Wait for the first coroutine to return, where coroutines can also
    be :class:`asyncio.Event`.

    Returns :class:`mode.services.WaitResults` with fields:

        - ``.done`` - List of arguments that are now done.
        - ``.results`` - List of return values in order of ``.done``.
        - ``.stopped`` - Set to True if the service was stopped.

.. _version-2.0.2:

2.0.2
=====
:release-date: 2018-11-03 9:07 A.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Now depends on :pypi:`aiocontextvars` 0.2

    This release uses :pep:`508` syntax for conditional requirements,
    as :ref:`version-2.0.1` did not work when installing wheel.

.. _version-2.0.1:

2.0.1
=====
:release-date: 2018-11-02 7:38 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Now depends on :pypi:`aiocontextvars` 0.2

.. _version-2.0.0:

2.0.0
=====
:release-date: 2018-11-02 9:12 A.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Services now create the event loop on demand.

    This means the event loop is no longer created in `Service.__init__`
    so that services can be defined at module scope without initializing
    the loop.

    This makes the ``ServiceProxy`` pattern redundant for most use cases.

- Adds ``.utils.compat.current_task`` as alias for
  :mod:`asyncio.current_task`.

- Adds support for contextvars in Python 3.6 using :pypi:`aiocontextvars`.

    In mode services you can now use :mod:`contextvars` module even
    on Python 3.6, thanks to the work of :github_user:`fantix`.

.. _version-1.18.2:

1.18.2
======
:release-date: 2018-11-30 6:23 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Worker: SIGUSR1 cry handler: Fixed crash when coroutine does not have
  ``__name__`` attribute.

.. _version-1.18.1:

1.18.1
======
:release-date: 2018-10-03 2:49 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- **Service**: ``Service.from_awaitable(coro)`` improvements.

    The resulting ``service.start`` will now:

    + Convert awaitable to :class:`asyncio.Task`.
    + Wait for task to complete.

    then ``service.stop`` will:

    + Cancel the task.

    This ensures an ``asyncio.sleep(10.0)`` within can be
    cancelled. If you need some operation to absolutely finish you must
    use `asyncio.shield`.

- **Utils**: ``cached_property`` adds new ``.is_set(o)`` method on descriptor

    This can be used to test for the attribute having been cached/used.

    If you have a class with a ``cached_property``:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        from mode.utils.objects import cached_property

        class X:

            @cached_property
            def foo(self):
                return 42

        x = X()
        print(x.foo)

    From an instance you can now check if the property was accessed:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        if type(x).foo.is_set(x):
            print(f'Someone accessed x.foo and it was cached as: {x.foo}')

.. _version-1.18.0:

1.18.0
======
:release-date: 2018-10-02 3:32 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- **Worker**: Fixed error when starting :pypi:`aioconsole` on ``--debug``

    The worker would crash with:

    .. sourcecode:: text

        TypeError: Use `self.add_context(ctx)` for non-async context

    when started with the ``--debug`` flag.

- **Worker**: New ``daemon`` argument controls shutdown of worker.

    When the flag is enabled, the default, the worker will not shut
    down until the worker instance is either explicitly stopped, or
    it receives a terminating process signal (``SIGINT``/``SIGTERM``/etc.)

    When disabled, the worker for the given service will shut down as soon as
    ``await service.start()`` returns.

    You can think of it as a flag for daemons, but one that doesn't actually
    do any of the UNIX daemonization stuff (detaching, etc.). It merely
    means the worker continues to run in the background until stopped by
    signal.

- **Service**: Added class method: ``Service.from_awaitable``.

    This can be used to create a service out of any coroutine
    or :class:`~typing.Awaitable`:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        from mode import Service, Worker

        async def me(interval=1.0):
            print('ME STARTING')
            await asyncio.sleep(interval)
            print('ME STOPPING')

        def run_worker(interval=1.0):
            coro = me(interval=1.0)
            Worker(Service.from_awaitable(coro)).execute_from_commandline()

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            run_worker()

    .. note::

        Using a service with ``await self.sleep(1.0)`` is often not what
        you want, as stopping the service will have to wait for the sleep
        to finish.

        ``Service.from_awaitable`` is as such a last resort for cases
        where you're provided a coroutine you cannot implement as a service.

        ``Service.sleep()`` is useful as it will stop sleeping immediately
        if the service is stopped:

            class Me(Service):

                async def on_start(self) -> None:
                    await self.sleep(1.0)

- **Service**: New method ``_repr_name`` can be used to override the service
               class name used in ``repr(service)``.

.. _version-1.17.3:

1.17.3
======
:release-date: 2018-09-18 4:00 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Service: New attribute ``mundane_level`` decides the logging level
  of mundane logging events such as "[X] Starting...", for starting/stopping
  and tasks being cancelled.

    The value for this must be a logger level name, and is ``"info"`` by
    default.

    If logging for a service is noisy at info-level, you can move it
    to debug level by setting this attribute to ``"debug"``:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        class X(Service):
            mundane_level = 'debug'

.. _version-1.17.2:

1.17.2
======
:release-date: 2018-09-17 3:00 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Removed and fixed import from ``collections`` that will be moved
  to ``collections.abc`` in Python 3.8.

    This also silences a ``DeprecationWarning`` that was being emitted
    on Python 3.7.

- Type annotations now passing checks on :pypi:`mypy` 0.630.

.. _version-1.17.1:

1.17.1
======
:release-date: 2018-09-13 6:27 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- Fixes several bugs related to unwrapping ``Optional[List[..]]``
  in :func:`mode.utils.objects.annotations`.

    This functionality is not really related to mode at all, so
    should be moved out of this library.  Faust uses it for models.

:release-by: Ask Solem (:github_user:`ask`)

- New async iterator utility: :class:`~mode.utils.aiter.arange`

    Like :class:`range` but returns an async iterator::

        async for n in arange(0, 10, 2):
            ...

- New async iterator utility: :func:`~mode.utils.aiter.aslice`

    Like :class:`itertools.islice` but works on asynchronous iterators.

- New async iterator utility: :func:`~mode.utils.aiter.chunks`

    :class:`~mode.utils.aiter.chunks` takes an async iterable and divides
    it up into chunks of size n::

        # Split range of 100 numbers into chunks of 10 each.
        async for chunk in chunks(arange(100), 10):
            yield chunk

    This gives chunks like this::

        [
            [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
            [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
            ...,
        ]

- **Requirements**

    + Now depends on :ref:`Mode 1.15.1 <mode:version-1.15.1>`.

        Contributed by Michael Seifert

- **Distribution**: Installing mode no longer installs the ``t`` directory
                    containing tests as a Python package.

    Contributed by Michael Seifert

- **Testing**: New :class:`~mode.utils.mocks.AsyncContextManagerMock`

    You can use this to mock asynchronous context managers.

    Please see :class:`~mode.utils.mocks.AsyncContextManagerMock` for
    an example.

- **CI**: Python 3.7.0 and 3.6.0 was added to the build matrix.

- Worker: Logging can now be set up using dictionary config, by passing
  the ``logging_config`` argument to :class:`mode.Worker`.

    Contributed by Allison Wang.

- Worker: No longer supports the ``logformat`` argument.

    To set up custom log format you must now pass in dict configuration
    via the ``logging_config`` argument.

- Service: ``start()`` accidentally silenced :exc:`asyncio.CancelledError`.

- Service: Invalid assert caused :class:`~mode.CrashingSupervisor` to
  crash with strange error

- Mode now registers as a library having static type annotations.

    This conforms to :pep:`561` -- a new specification that defines
    how Python libraries register type stubs to make them available
    for use with static analyzers like :pypi:`mypy` and :pypi:`pyre-check`.

- The code base now passes ``--strict-optional`` type checks.

======
:release-date: 2018-05-07 3:20 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Adds new mock class for async functions: :func:`mode.utils.mocks.AsyncMock`

    This can be used to mock an async callable::

        from mode.utils.mocks import AsyncMock

        class App(Service):

            async def on_start(self):
                self.ret = await self.some_async_method('arg')

            async def some_async_method(self, arg):
                await asyncio.sleep(1)

        @pytest.fixture
        def app():
            return App()

        @pytest.mark.asyncio
        async def test_something(*, app):
            app.some_async_method = AsyncMock()
            async with app: # starts and stops the service, calling on_start
                app.some_async_method.assert_called_once_with('arg')
                assert app.ret is app.some_async_method.coro.return_value

- Added 100% test coverage for modules:

    + :mod:`mode.proxy`
    + :mod:`mode.threads`
    + :mod:`mode.utils.aiter`

Important Notes
---------------

- Moved to https://github.com/ask/mode

Changes
-------

- Signal: Improved repr when signal has a default sender.

- DictAttribute: Now supports ``len`` and ``del(d[key])``.

- Worker: If overriding ``on_first_start`` you can now call
  ``default_on_first_start`` instead of super.

    Example::

        class MyWorker(Worker):

            async def on_first_start(self) -> None:
                print('FIRST START')
                await self.default_on_first_start()

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

+ Changed ``Service.add_context``

    - To add an async context manager (:class:`~typing.AsyncContextManager`),
      use :meth:`~mode.Service.add_async_context`::

        class S(Service):

            async def on_start(self) -> None:
                self.context = await self.add_async_context(MyAsyncContext())

    - To add a regular context manager (:class:`~typing.ContextManager`),
      use :meth:`~mode.Service.add_context`::

        class S(Service):

            async def on_start(self) -> None:
                self.context = self.add_context(MyContext())

    This change was made so that contexts can be added from non-async
    functions. To add an *async context* you still need to be within an
    async function definition.

News
----

+ Worker: Now redirects :data:`sys.stdout` and :data:`sys.stderr` to the
          logging subsystem by default.

    - To disable this pass ``Worker(redirect_stdouts=False)``.

    - The default severity level for ``print`` statements are
      :data:`logging.WARN`, but you can change this using
      ``Worker(redirect_stdouts_level='INFO')``.

+ :class:`~mode.Seconds`/:func:`~mode.want_seconds` can now be expressed
  as strings and rate strings:

    - float as string: ``want_seconds('1.203') == 1.203``

    - *10 in one second*: ``want_seconds('10/s') == 10.0``

    - *10.33 in one hour*: ``want_seconds('10.3/h') == 0.0028611111111111116``

    - *100 in one hour*: ``want_seconds('100/h') == 0.02777777777777778``

    - *100 in one day*: ``want_seconds('100/d') == 0.0011574074074074076``

    This is especially useful for the rate argument
    to the :class:`~mode.utils.times.rate_limit` helper.

+ Added new context manager: :func:`mode.utils.logging.redirect_stdouts`.

+ Module :mod:`mode.types` now organized by category:

    - Service types: :mod:`mode.types.services`

    - Signal types: :mod:`mode.types.signals`

    - Supervisor types: :mod:`mode.types.supervisors`

+ :class:`mode.flight_recorder` can now wrap objects so that every method call
  on that object will result in the call and arguments to that call
  being logged.

    Example logging statements with ``INFO`` severity::

        with flight_recorder(logger, timeout=10.0) as on_timeout:
            redis = on_timeout.wrap_info(self.redis)
            await redis.get(key)

    There's also ``wrap_debug(o)``, ``wrap_warn(o)``, ``wrap_error(o)``,
    and for any severity: ``wrap(logging.CRIT, o)``.

Fixes
-----

+ Fixed bug in ``Service.wait`` on Python 3.7.

1.11.4
======
:release-date: 2018-04-19 9:36 A.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

+ Adds :class:`mode.flight_recorder`

    This is a logging utility to log stuff only when something
    times out.

    For example if you have a background thread that is sometimes
    hanging::

        class RedisCache(mode.Service):

            @mode.timer(1.0)
            def _background_refresh(self) -> None:
                self._users = await self.redis_client.get(USER_KEY)
                self._posts = await self.redis_client.get(POSTS_KEY)

    You want to figure out on what line this is hanging, but logging
    all the time will provide way too much output, and will even change
    how fast the program runs and that can mask race conditions, so that
    they never happen.

    Use the flight recorder to save the logs and only log when it times out:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        logger = mode.get_logger(__name__)

        class RedisCache(mode.Service):

            @mode.timer(1.0)
            def _background_refresh(self) -> None:
                with mode.flight_recorder(logger, timeout=10.0) as on_timeout:
                    on_timeout.info(f'+redis_client.get({USER_KEY!r})')
                    await self.redis_client.get(USER_KEY)
                    on_timeout.info(f'-redis_client.get({USER_KEY!r})')

                    on_timeout.info(f'+redis_client.get({POSTS_KEY!r})')
                    await self.redis_client.get(POSTS_KEY)
                    on_timeout.info(f'-redis_client.get({POSTS_KEY!r})')

    If the body of this :keyword:`with` statement completes before the
    timeout, the logs are forgotten about and never emitted -- if it
    takes more than ten seconds to complete, we will see these messages
    in the log:

    .. sourcecode:: text

        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,877: WARNING]: Warning: Task timed out!
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: WARNING]: Please make sure it is hanging before restarting.
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: INFO]: [Flight Recorder-1] (started at Thu Apr 19 09:43:45 2018) Replaying logs...
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: INFO]: [Flight Recorder-1] (Thu Apr 19 09:43:45 2018) +redis_client.get('user')
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: INFO]: [Flight Recorder-1] (Thu Apr 19 09:43:49 2018) -redis_client.get('user')
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: INFO]: [Flight Recorder-1] (Thu Apr 19 09:43:46 2018) +redis_client.get('posts')
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: INFO]: [Flight Recorder-1] -End of log-

    Now we know this ``redis_client.get`` call can take too long to complete,
    and should consider adding a timeout to it.

Backward Incompatible Changes
=============================

- Module ``mode.utils.debug`` renamed to :mod:`mode.debug`.

    This is unlikely to affect users as this module is only used by mode
    internally.

    This module had to move because it imports ``mode.Service``, and
    the :mod:`mode.utils` package is not allowed to import from the
    :mod:`mode` package at all.

News
====

- Added function :func:`mode.utils.import.smart_import`.

- Added non-async version of :class:`mode.Signal`: :class:`mode.SyncSignal`.

    The signal works exactly the same as the asynchronous version, except
    ``Signal.send`` must not be :keyword:`await`-ed::

        on_configured = SyncSignal()
        on_configured.send(sender=obj)


- Added method ``iterate`` to :class:`mode.utils.imports.FactoryMapping`.

    This enables you to iterate over the extensions added to a
    :mod:`setuptools` entrypoint.

Fixes
=====

- ``StampedeWrapper`` now correctly clears flag when original call done.

:release-date: 2018-02-20 04:01 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

- API Change to fix memory leak in ``Service.wait``.

    The ``Service.wait(*futures)`` method was added to be able to wait for
    this list of futures but also stop waiting if the service is stopped or
    crashed::

        import asyncio
        from mode import Service

        class X(Service):
            on_thing_ready: asyncio.Event

            def __post_init__(self):
                self.on_thing_ready = asyncio.Event(loop=loop)

            @Service.task
            async def _my_background_task(self):
                while not self.should_stop:
                    # wait for flag to be set (or service stopped/crashed)
                    await self.wait(self.on_thing_ready.wait())
                    print('FLAG SET')

    The problem with this was

    1) The wait flag would return None and not raise an exception if the
       service is stopped/crashed.
    2) Futures would be scheduled on the event loop but not properly cleaned
       up, creating a very slow memory leak.
    3) No return value was returned for succesful feature.

    So to properly implement this we had to change the API of the ``wait``
    method to return a tuple instead, and to only allow a single coroutine to
    be passed to wait::

        @Service.task
        async def _my_background_task(self):
            while not self.should_stop:
                # wait for flag to be set (or service stopped/crashed)
                result, stopped = await self.wait(self.on_thing_ready)
                if not stopped:
                    print('FLAG SET')

    This way the user can provide an alternate path when the service is
    stopped/crashed while waiting for this event.

    A new shortcut method ``wait_for_stopped(fut)`` was also added::

        # wait for flag to be set (or service stopped/crashed)
        if not await self.wait_for_stopped(self.on_thing_ready):
            print('FLAG SET')

    Moreover, you can now pass :class:`asyncio.Event` objects directly to
    ``wait()``.

News
----

- Added :class:`mode.utils.collections.DictAttribute`.

- Added :class:`mode.utils.collections.AttributeDict`.

Bugs
----

- Signals can create clone of signal with default sender already set

        signal = signal.with_default_sender(obj)

.. _version-1.7.0:

  data structures.

- Adds :mod:`mode.utils.imports` for importing modules at runtime,
  as well as utilities for typed :mod:`setuptools` entry-points.

- Adds :mod:`mode.utils.text` for fuzzy matching user input.

.. _version-1.6.0:

1.6.0
=====
:release-date: 2018-02-05 11:10 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Fixed bug where ``@Service.task`` background tasks were not started
  in subclasses.

- Service: Now has two exit stacks: ``.exit_stack`` & ``.async_exit_stack``.

    This is a backward incompatible change, but probably nobody was accessing
    ``.exit_stack`` directly.

    Use ``await Service.enter_context(ctx)`` with both regular and
    asynchronous context managers::

        class X(Service):

            async def on_start(self) -> None:
                # works with both context manager types.
                await self.enter_context(async_context)
                await self.enter_context(context)

- Adds :func:`~mode.utils.contextlib.asynccontextmanager`` decorator
  from CPython 3.7b1.

    This decorator works exactly the same as
    :func:`contextlib.contextmanager`, but for :keyword:`async with`.

    Import it from :mod:`mode.utils.contexts`::

        from mode.utils.contexts import asynccontextmanager

        @asynccontextmanager
        async def connection_or_default(conn: Connection = None) -> Connection:
            if connection is None:
                async with connection_pool.acquire():
                    yield
            else:
                yield connection

        async def main():
            async with connection_or_default() as connection:
                ...

- Adds :class:`~mode.utils.contexts.AsyncExitStack` from CPython 3.7b1

    This works like :class:`contextlib.ExitStack`, but for asynchronous
    context managers used with :keyword:`async with`.

- Logging: Worker debug log messages are now colored blue when colors are
  enabled.


.. _version-1.5.0:

1.5.0
=====
:release-date: 2018-01-04 03:43 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Service: Adds new ``await self.add_context(context)``

    This adds a new context manager to be entered when the service starts,
    and exited once the service exits.

    The context manager can be either a :class:`typing.AsyncContextManager`
    (:keyword:`async with`) or a
    regular :class:`typing.ContextManager` (:keyword:`with`).

- Service: Added ``await self.add_runtime_dependency()`` which unlike
  ``add_dependency`` starts the dependent service if the self is already
  started.

- Worker: Now supports a new ``console_port`` argument to specify a port
  for the :pypi:`aiomonitor` console, different than the default (50101).

    .. note::

        The aiomonitor console is only started when ``Worker(debug=True, ...)``
        is set.

- Renames PoisonpillSupervisor to CrashingSupervisor.

- Child services now stopped even if not fully started.

    Previously ``child_service.stop()`` would not be called
    if `child_service.start()` never completed, but as a service
    might be in the process of starting other child services, we need
    to call stop even if not fully started.

.. _version-1.1.1:

1.1.1
=====
:release-date: 2017-10-25 04:34 P.M PDT

- Added alternative event loop implementations: eventlet, gevent, uvloop.

    E.g. to use gevent as the event loop, install mode using:

    .. sourcecode:: console

        $ pip install mode[gevent]

    and add this line to the top of your worker entrypoint module::

        import mode.loop
        mode.loop.use('gevent')

- Service: More fixes for the weird `__init_subclass__` behavior
  only seen in Python 3.6.3.

- ServiceThread: Now propagates errors raised in the thread
  to the main thread.

- ServiceThread: Now inherits from Service, and uses
  ``loop.run_in_executor()`` to start the service as a thread.

- setup_logging: filename argument is now respected.

.. _version-1.0.2:

1.0.2
=====
:release-date: 2017-10-10 01:51 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Adds support for Python 3.6.0

- Adds backports of typing improvements in CPython 3.6.1
  to ``mode.utils.compat``: ``AsyncContextManager``, ``ChainMap``,
  ``Counter``, and ``Deque``.
