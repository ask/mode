.. _version-1.13.0:

1.13.0
======
:release-date: 2018-05-16 1:26 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Mode now registers as a library having static type annotations.

    This conforms to :pep:`561` -- a new specification that defines
    how Python libraries register type stubs to make them available
    for use with static analyzers like :pypi:`mypy` and :pypi:`pyre-check`.

- The code base now passes ``--strict-optional`` type checks.

.. _version-1.12.5:

1.12.5
======
:release-date: 2018-05-14 4:48 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Supervisor: Fixed wrong index calculation in management
  of index-based service restart.

.. _version-1.12.4:

1.12.4
======
:release-date: 2018-05-07 3:20 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Adds new mock class for async functions: :func:`mode.utils.mocks.AsyncMock`

    This can be used to mock an async callable::

        from mode.utils.mocks import AsyncMock

        class App(Service):

            async def on_start(self):
                self.ret = await self.some_async_method('arg')

            async def some_async_method(self, arg):
                await asyncio.sleep(1)

        @pytest.fixture
        def app():
            return App()

        @pytest.mark.asyncio
        async def test_something(*, app):
            app.some_async_method = AsyncMock()
            async with app: # starts and stops the service, calling on_start
                app.some_async_method.assert_called_once_with('arg')
                assert app.ret is app.some_async_method.coro.return_value

- Added 100% test coverage for modules:

    + :mod:`mode.proxy`
    + :mod:`mode.threads`
    + :mod:`mode.utils.aiter`

.. _version-1.12.3:

1.12.3
======
:release-date: 2018-05-07 3:33 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

Important Notes
---------------

- Moved to https://github.com/ask/mode

Changes
-------

- Signal: Improved repr when signal has a default sender.

- DictAttribute: Now supports ``len`` and ``del(d[key])``.

- Worker: If overriding ``on_first_start`` you can now call
  ``default_on_first_start`` instead of super.

    Example::

        class MyWorker(Worker):

            async def on_first_start(self) -> None:
                print('FIRST START')
                await self.default_on_first_start()

.. _version-1.12.2:

1.12.2
======
:release-date: 2018-04-26 11:47 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Fixed shutdown error in :class:`~mode.threads.ServiceThread`.

.. _version-1.12.1:

1.12.1
======
:release-date: 2018-04-24 11:28 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Now works with CPython 3.6.1 and 3.6.0.

.. _version-1.12.0:

1.12.0
======
:release-date: 2018-04-23 1:28 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

+ Changed ``Service.add_context``

    - To add an async context manager (:class:`~typing.AsyncContextManager`),
      use :meth:`~mode.Service.add_async_context`::

        class S(Service):

            async def on_start(self) -> None:
                self.context = await self.add_async_context(MyAsyncContext())

    - To add a regular context manager (:class:`~typing.ContextManager`),
      use :meth:`~mode.Service.add_context`::

        class S(Service):

            async def on_start(self) -> None:
                self.context = self.add_context(MyContext())

    This change was made so that contexts can be added from non-async
    functions. To add an *async context* you still need to be within an
    async function definition.

News
----

+ Worker: Now redirects :data:`sys.stdout` and :data:`sys.stderr` to the
          logging subsystem by default.

    - To disable this pass ``Worker(redirect_stdouts=False)``.

    - The default severity level for ``print`` statements are
      :data:`logging.WARN`, but you can change this using
      ``Worker(redirect_stdouts_level='INFO')``.

+ :class:`~mode.Seconds`/:func:`~mode.want_seconds` can now be expressed
  as strings and rate strings:

    - float as string: ``want_seconds('1.203') == 1.203``

    - *10 in one second*: ``want_seconds('10/s') == 10.0``

    - *10.33 in one hour*: ``want_seconds('10.3/h') == 0.0028611111111111116``

    - *100 in one hour*: ``want_seconds('100/h') == 0.02777777777777778``

    - *100 in one day*: ``want_seconds('100/d') == 0.0011574074074074076``

    This is especially useful for the rate argument
    to the :class:`~mode.utils.times.rate_limit` helper.

+ Added new context manager: :func:`mode.utils.logging.redirect_stdouts`.

+ Module :mod:`mode.types` now organized by category:

    - Service types: :mod:`mode.types.services`

    - Signal types: :mod:`mode.types.signals`

    - Supervisor types: :mod:`mode.types.supervisors`

+ :class:`mode.flight_recorder` can now wrap objects so that every method call
  on that object will result in the call and arguments to that call
  being logged.

    Example logging statements with ``INFO`` severity::

        with flight_recorder(logger, timeout=10.0) as on_timeout:
            redis = on_timeout.wrap_info(self.redis)
            await redis.get(key)

    There's also ``wrap_debug(o)``, ``wrap_warn(o)``, ``wrap_error(o)``,
    and for any severity: ``wrap(logging.CRIT, o)``.

Fixes
-----

+ Fixed bug in ``Service.wait`` on Python 3.7.

.. _version-1.11.5:

1.11.5
======
:release-date: 2018-04-19 3:12 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

+ FlowControlQueue now available in ``mode.utils.queues``.

    This is a backward compatible change.

+ Tests for FlowControlQueue

.. _version-1.11.4:

1.11.4
======
:release-date: 2018-04-19 9:36 A.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

+ Adds :class:`mode.flight_recorder`

    This is a logging utility to log stuff only when something
    times out.

    For example if you have a background thread that is sometimes
    hanging::

        class RedisCache(mode.Service):

            @mode.timer(1.0)
            def _background_refresh(self) -> None:
                self._users = await self.redis_client.get(USER_KEY)
                self._posts = await self.redis_client.get(POSTS_KEY)

    You want to figure out on what line this is hanging, but logging
    all the time will provide way too much output, and will even change
    how fast the program runs and that can mask race conditions, so that
    they never happen.

    Use the flight recorder to save the logs and only log when it times out:

    .. sourcecode:: python

        logger = mode.get_logger(__name__)

        class RedisCache(mode.Service):

            @mode.timer(1.0)
            def _background_refresh(self) -> None:
                with mode.flight_recorder(logger, timeout=10.0) as on_timeout:
                    on_timeout.info(f'+redis_client.get({USER_KEY!r})')
                    await self.redis_client.get(USER_KEY)
                    on_timeout.info(f'-redis_client.get({USER_KEY!r})')

                    on_timeout.info(f'+redis_client.get({POSTS_KEY!r})')
                    await self.redis_client.get(POSTS_KEY)
                    on_timeout.info(f'-redis_client.get({POSTS_KEY!r})')

    If the body of this :keyword:`with` statement completes before the
    timeout, the logs are forgotten about and never emitted -- if it
    takes more than ten seconds to complete, we will see these messages
    in the log:

    .. sourcecode:: text

        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,877: WARNING]: Warning: Task timed out!
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: WARNING]: Please make sure it is hanging before restarting.
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: INFO]: [Flight Recorder-1] (started at Thu Apr 19 09:43:45 2018) Replaying logs...
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: INFO]: [Flight Recorder-1] (Thu Apr 19 09:43:45 2018) +redis_client.get('user')
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: INFO]: [Flight Recorder-1] (Thu Apr 19 09:43:49 2018) -redis_client.get('user')
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: INFO]: [Flight Recorder-1] (Thu Apr 19 09:43:46 2018) +redis_client.get('posts')
        [2018-04-19 09:43:55,878: INFO]: [Flight Recorder-1] -End of log-

    Now we know this ``redis_client.get`` call can take too long to complete,
    and should consider adding a timeout to it.

:release-date: 2018-03-05 11:33 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

Backward Incompatible Changes
=============================

- Module ``mode.utils.debug`` renamed to :mod:`mode.debug`.

    This is unlikely to affect users as this module is only used by mode
    internally.

    This module had to move because it imports ``mode.Service``, and
    the :mod:`mode.utils` package is not allowed to import from the
    :mod:`mode` package at all.

News
====

- Added function :func:`mode.utils.import.smart_import`.

- Added non-async version of :class:`mode.Signal`: :class:`mode.SyncSignal`.

    The signal works exactly the same as the asynchronous version, except
    ``Signal.send`` must not be :keyword:`await`-ed::

        on_configured = SyncSignal()
        on_configured.send(sender=obj)


- Added method ``iterate`` to :class:`mode.utils.imports.FactoryMapping`.

    This enables you to iterate over the extensions added to a
    :mod:`setuptools` entrypoint.

Fixes
=====

- ``StampedeWrapper`` now correctly clears flag when original call done.

.. _version-1.8.0:

1.8.0
=====
:release-date: 2018-02-20 04:01 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

Backward Incompatible Changes
-----------------------------

- API Change to fix memory leak in ``Service.wait``.

    The ``Service.wait(*futures)`` method was added to be able to wait for
    this list of futures but also stop waiting if the service is stopped or
    crashed::

        import asyncio
        from mode import Service

        class X(Service):
            on_thing_ready: asyncio.Event

            def __post_init__(self):
                self.on_thing_ready = asyncio.Event(loop=loop)

            @Service.task
            async def _my_background_task(self):
                while not self.should_stop:
                    # wait for flag to be set (or service stopped/crashed)
                    await self.wait(self.on_thing_ready.wait())
                    print('FLAG SET')

    The problem with this was

    1) The wait flag would return None and not raise an exception if the
       service is stopped/crashed.
    2) Futures would be scheduled on the event loop but not properly cleaned
       up, creating a very slow memory leak.
    3) No return value was returned for succesful feature.

    So to properly implement this we had to change the API of the ``wait``
    method to return a tuple instead, and to only allow a single coroutine to
    be passed to wait::

        @Service.task
        async def _my_background_task(self):
            while not self.should_stop:
                # wait for flag to be set (or service stopped/crashed)
                result, stopped = await self.wait(self.on_thing_ready)
                if not stopped:
                    print('FLAG SET')

    This way the user can provide an alternate path when the service is
    stopped/crashed while waiting for this event.

    A new shortcut method ``wait_for_stopped(fut)`` was also added::

        # wait for flag to be set (or service stopped/crashed)
        if not await self.wait_for_stopped(self.on_thing_ready):
            print('FLAG SET')

    Moreover, you can now pass :class:`asyncio.Event` objects directly to
    ``wait()``.

News
----

- Added :class:`mode.utils.collections.DictAttribute`.

- Added :class:`mode.utils.collections.AttributeDict`.

Bugs
----

- Signals can create clone of signal with default sender already set

    .. code-block:: python

        signal: Signal[int] = Signal()
        signal = signal.with_default_sender(obj)

.. _version-1.7.0:

1.7.0
=====
:release-date: 2018-02-05 12:28 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Adds :mod:`mode.utils.aiter` for missing ``aiter`` and ``anext`` functions.

- Adds :mod:`mode.utils.futures` for :class:`asyncio.Task` related tools.

- Adds :mod:`mode.utils.collections` for custom mapping/set and list
  data structures.

- Adds :mod:`mode.utils.imports` for importing modules at runtime,
  as well as utilities for typed :mod:`setuptools` entry-points.

- Adds :mod:`mode.utils.text` for fuzzy matching user input.

.. _version-1.6.0:

1.6.0
=====
:release-date: 2018-02-05 11:10 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Fixed bug where ``@Service.task`` background tasks were not started
  in subclasses.

- Service: Now has two exit stacks: ``.exit_stack`` & ``.async_exit_stack``.

    This is a backward incompatible change, but probably nobody was accessing
    ``.exit_stack`` directly.

    Use ``await Service.enter_context(ctx)`` with both regular and
    asynchronous context managers::

        class X(Service):

            async def on_start(self) -> None:
                # works with both context manager types.
                await self.enter_context(async_context)
                await self.enter_context(context)

- Adds :func:`~mode.utils.contextlib.asynccontextmanager`` decorator
  from CPython 3.7b1.

    This decorator works exactly the same as
    :func:`contextlib.contextmanager`, but for :keyword:`async with`.

    Import it from :mod:`mode.utils.contexts`::

        from mode.utils.contexts import asynccontextmanager

        @asynccontextmanager
        async def connection_or_default(conn: Connection = None) -> Connection:
            if connection is None:
                async with connection_pool.acquire():
                    yield
            else:
                yield connection

        async def main():
            async with connection_or_default() as connection:
                ...

- Adds :class:`~mode.utils.contexts.AsyncExitStack` from CPython 3.7b1

    This works like :class:`contextlib.ExitStack`, but for asynchronous
    context managers used with :keyword:`async with`.

- Logging: Worker debug log messages are now colored blue when colors are
  enabled.


.. _version-1.5.0:

1.5.0
=====
:release-date: 2018-01-04 03:43 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Service: Adds new ``await self.add_context(context)``

    This adds a new context manager to be entered when the service starts,
    and exited once the service exits.

    The context manager can be either a :class:`typing.AsyncContextManager`
    (:keyword:`async with`) or a
    regular :class:`typing.ContextManager` (:keyword:`with`).

- Service: Added ``await self.add_runtime_dependency()`` which unlike
  ``add_dependency`` starts the dependent service if the self is already
  started.

- Worker: Now supports a new ``console_port`` argument to specify a port
  for the :pypi:`aiomonitor` console, different than the default (50101).

    .. note::

        The aiomonitor console is only started when ``Worker(debug=True, ...)``
        is set.

.. _version-1.4.0:

.. _version-1.3.0:

1.3.0
=====
:release-date: 2017-12-04 01:17 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Now supports color output in logs when logging to a terminal.

- Now depends on :pypi:`colorlog`

- Added :class:`mode.Signal`: async. implementation of the observer
  pattern (think Django signals).

- DependencyGraph is now a generic type: ``DependencyGraph[int]``

- Node is now a generic type: ``Node[Service]``.

.. _version-1.2.1:

1.2.1
=====
:release-date: 2017-11-06 04:50 P.M PST
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Service: Subclasses can now override a Service.task method.

    Previously it would unexpectedly start two tasks:
    the task defined in the superclass and the task defined in
    the subclass.

.. _version-1.2.0:

1.2.0
=====
:release-date: 2017-11-02 03:17 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Renames PoisonpillSupervisor to CrashingSupervisor.

- Child services now stopped even if not fully started.

    Previously ``child_service.stop()`` would not be called
    if `child_service.start()` never completed, but as a service
    might be in the process of starting other child services, we need
    to call stop even if not fully started.

.. _version-1.1.1:

1.1.1
=====
:release-date: 2017-10-25 04:34 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- Added alternative event loop implementations: eventlet, gevent, uvloop.

    E.g. to use gevent as the event loop, install mode using:

    .. sourcecode:: console

        $ pip install mode[gevent]

    and add this line to the top of your worker entrypoint module::

        import mode.loop
        mode.loop.use('gevent')

- Service: More fixes for the weird `__init_subclass__` behavior
  only seen in Python 3.6.3.

- ServiceThread: Now propagates errors raised in the thread
  to the main thread.

.. _version-1.1.0:

1.1.0
=====
:release-date: 2017-10-19 01:35 P.M PDT
:release-by: Ask Solem

- ServiceThread: Now inherits from Service, and uses
  ``loop.run_in_executor()`` to start the service as a thread.

- setup_logging: filename argument is now respected.

.. _version-1.0.2:
